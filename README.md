This is an experiment in creating an app for better song learning. It allows for marking a section
of a song and playing it with different speed.

It's written in **Lua** with **Love2D** framework.

Keys:

- **1** and **2** are used to set markers
- **L** toggles looping
- **Space** play/pause
- **arrow keys** scrub forward and back
- **9** and **0** to control playback pitch/speed
